Our Junior School is a colourful, warm, welcoming and inspiring place for students to explore and learn.
 

First School
Students in Reception, Year 1 and Year 2 are taught in our First School. Here they will learn how to become curious, confident and independent learners. A team of qualified teachers and Learning Assistants will nurture the child and help them to find their passions, in and out of the classroom, whilst navigating a busy school life.

Classrooms are large and play areas are interactive and inspiring. A school within a school, the First School has its own Library, Auditorium, computer science labs, art rooms and music areas.

For many students English is their second language. Teachers encourage students to transition to using English in all areas of learning and play, whilst maintaining a fluency with their mother tongue.

Students are introduced to key subjects such as Maths, English, Science, Languages, Music, Art, Dance, Drama and Humanities.

Very quickly our younger students find a love for learning.

Jeremy Freeman
Head of Junior School


Lower School
As students progress through the School the surroundings adapt to their changing needs. Our Lower School, like the First School, is bright and airy, with its own larger facilities including a large auditorium and well stocked Library.

Our Lower School is home to students in Year 3 to Year 6.

A greater emphasis is placed on academic achievement and students are introduced to more subject matter, all following a traditional British curriculum. They are encouraged to become more independent with their learning and to delve deeper into subject areas.

Outside of the classroom there are many opportunities for leadership and personal skill development.

In Years 5 and 6 students are taught by subject specialists, this provides a greater understanding of a subject area and prepares them for Senior School where all lessons are subject specific.

Following on from the First School, students will continue to learn Maths, English, Science, Languages, Music, Art, Dance, Drama and Humanities.

Students in Year 5 and 6 also have the opportunity to live on campus in one of our boarding homes.

A love of learning starts in our Junior School.



Senior School
The Senior School provides a rigorous academic education taught by highly qualified, knowledgeable and inspiring teachers through lively, active lessons. Students are challenged to think for themselves and to develop their minds independently.

In Year 7 to Year 9, students continue to study a British Curriculum, with Year 10 being the start of the two year, world recognised, IGCSE programme. 

All classes are taught in English (other than languages) and a student’s understanding and fluency of English is elevated, whilst always maintaining a high level of their first language skills. 

Students each have a Tutor and all lessons are taught by specialist teachers, with all classes taking place in designated areas with all the student needs to thrive academically. 

To further enhance learning students have access to subject specific societies, interactive areas on campus and regular trips off campus to reconfirm what they are learning in the classroom.

Vice Principal Academic

In Year 12 and 13 our students become part of our Sixth Form. A stepping stone between Senior School and University. Where a love of learning becomes more focused.
 

Sixth Form
The Sixth Form team is led by our Assistant Vice Principal (Academic – Head of Sixth Form) who is ably supported by two Deputy Heads of Sixth Form, both with a Year Group responsibility. An IB Coordinator and a team of IB experts with focus on TOK ensure that our students are given the best possible opportunity to successfully complete their IB Diploma Programme.

Students are no longer required to wear a uniform, instead are to wear business attire, and the study environment provides a greater opportunity for subject exploration, independent learning and self discovery.

Our students achieve outstanding, higher than the global average, scores for IBDP and NLCS Jeju is recognised as a Top 60 World IB School.

Sixth Form students who live on campus will also benefit from residing in our Sixth Form Boarding Homes, which also provide an enhanced experience to prepare them for a university life away from home.

There are also a number of prestigious leadership opportunities available to our Sixth Form students. Find out more about Leadership Opportunities across the School.

Justine Oliver
Academic – Head of Sixth Form

IB Diploma
The IB Diploma, a globally recognised, academically rigorous qualification designed to address the intellectual, social and emotional and physical well-being of students.

The combination of breadth, scholarship and academic rigour offered by the IB Diploma programme ensures that our students enjoy an exciting and intellectually stimulating experience in the Sixth Form and that they will be provided with an excellent preparation for life at university and in the wider world beyond.

**Any questions regarding university**
NLCS Jeju is proud to share the list of University Acceptances for the class of 2024.
https://www.nlcsjeju.co.kr/academic-scholarship/university-destinations/


Our approach is marked by teaching our students how to take responsibility for the application process.
Communication among teachers, parents and students helps to create a supportive network to assist a student in finding the best university for him/her. Our programme focuses on the needs and desires of each individual student.

Formal higher education planning begins in Year 10. At the beginning of each academic year we work with each year group to ensure students have a clear understanding of how to create a competitive and individualised university application. Leadership skills and self-advocacy are skill sets we aim to develop in students over the four-year timeline. Each student will be assigned a University Guidance Counsellor who will work with them to research and develop a list of potential colleges or universities, plan appropriate summer activities and discuss resumes. Students meet regularly with their advisor to identify their strengths and areas for development, outline their interests, and develop a plan.

Pastoral Care
Our Class/Tutor teachers are assisted by Learning Assistants and Year Leads to ensure students are supported through their learning and development.
The Junior School focuses on a collaborative approach to wellbeing, with clear learning habits that not only support the students but give ownership to them to have their own positive impact on the community.

Richard Washington
Deputy Head Junior School (Pastoral)

Creative
We actively promote creativity in our students, encouraging them to try new things, not be afraid of challenges and to think outside the box.
Critical thinkers
We encourage critical and creative thinking skills to develop reasoned thoughts and viewpoints.
Courageous
We promote risk taking within and outside of the classroom, the willingness to try things out and push ourselves to greater levels
Open-Minded
We appreciate our own culture and history as well as the values and traditions of others. We understand there are different points of view and we grow from varied experiences.
Resilient
Children develop as unique individuals; this requires determination and endeavour combined with fun and enjoyment. Resilience is a key value to a successful life and high achievement.
Empathetic
NLCS Jeju students should appreciate others’ efforts and achievements. In the classroom, the art and music departments, within sport and during House competitions and during assemblies. Empathy towards others is a vital component of positive behaviour.
Respectful
We act with integrity and honesty in all we do. We take responsibility for our actions and their consequences and have respect for others at all times.
Kind
Students are encouraged to be the ‘i’ in Kind and always act with kindness to themselves and each other.

 
Pastoral Care
Within the Senior School students have a tight structure of support, from their Tutor, who they meet each morning, their class teachers and their Head of House teams – for those in boarding this extends to a large pastoral boarding team.
From the start there is a detailed and thorough induction process, with a successful buddying programme.

Students have access to a team of Emotional Guidance Counsellors who are available to talk through any of the concerns or worries the students may have.

Support is tailored to the needs of the students as they navigate through their studies and adolescence, with advice and guidance focused at the time of need.

Crispian Waterman
Vice Principal (Pastoral)

Pastoral Care
Students within our Sixth Form are independent learners, but the support system remains in place as they work through two very busy years of study, exams and university application preparation.
With two Assistant Vice Principals with responsibility for pastoral care, the continuation of daily tutor group meetings and a dedicated Sixth Form area and team on hand to help them navigate the challenges and reach their full potential.

As well as well equipped classrooms, the Sixth Form area boasts a number of break out and rest areas for students to recharge between classes, by making a hot drink, relaxing on a sofa in a peaceful environment or playing a game of pool with friends – allowing students to take responsibility for their own wellbeing.

The Sixth Form truly strikes a balance between hard work and personal wellbeing.

Dr. Maxton Karamalla
Head of Sixth Form Pastoral


Pastoral Care
Parents Workshops
Working with Parents we ensure that we provide the best opportunities for their children and our students. This is achieved by hosting a number of Parent workshops each term, as well as House and Boarding Home coffee mornings and afternoon teas.

Jason Sannegadu
Assistant Vice Principal
(Head of Houses)

As a boarding school, NLCS Jeju is a vibrant and busy School, 7 days a week.
Combining our three pillars – ‘academic excellence’, ‘exceptional pastoral care’ and incredible ‘co-curricular provisions’ for all our students, school life provides many opportunities for our students within a traditional House structure.



 

Houses
There are five Junior Houses and five Senior Houses at NLCS Jeju.

Leadership Opportunities
We believe that providing students with an opportunity to take on important roles with responsibilities and purpose helps them to contribute to the School community as well as enhancing their skill set and offering talking points for university applications.

The Big (and little) 8
A tradition from our founding school, students are selected in Year 12 to become the Big 8 for their final year of study at NLCS Jeju. At NLCS Jeju this extends to our Year 6 students who are graduating from our Junior School.

This is an important and prestigious role. A rigorous selection process ensures that the students who take on these positions are excellent role models and ambassadors for NLCS Jeju.

Throughout their tenure the Little and Big 8 have a number of important duties to fulfil, including leading events such as Senior School Assemblies, Founder’s Day and Valedictory. The chosen 8 have specialised areas of responsibility including sport, academics, the Arts and the Community. They are called upon throughout the year and are invaluable to the School.

Other Leadership Opportunities
There are a number of leadership opportunities across the School, in both Junior and Senior, below are just some of the roles.

The Student Council
In Senior School the Student Council is composed of Tutor Group Representatives and in our Junior School they are Year Group Representatives from Year 2 and above, they are instrumental in representing the voice of students within our School.

Prefects
Sixth Form Prefects are appointed in September and serve for a full school year. They contribute to the school community by working on a collaborative project, attend and support school events, deliver assemblies and perform duties alongside members of staff.

House Captains
The House Captains in both Junior and Senior School, help to coordinate the running of the School Houses, House events and House competitions, with our Junior School students leading their House during assemblies. The Senior School Students also form a House Committee.

Boarding Leadership
A boarding leadership team exists within each boarding Home. There are four committees (Academic, Wellbeing, Media and Events), each with a prefect and area team members. There are also Boarding Captains, a Boarding Council and Year Group Representatives, all supported by their BMs.

Ambassadors
A number of Ambassador roles exist at the School to provide a voice for that particular area. Students can become Ambassadors from Year 5 onwards. The Ambassador groups include Eco, Sport, Library, Student Welfare, Global Awareness, Music, the Arts and more! Students work closely with the staff in their respective area.

Peer Mentors
Older students have the opportunity to train as Peer Mentors. These students provide a listening and mentoring opportunity for our Year 7s and new students. Peer Mentors operate with the guidance of staff and are trained to support individual students over a sustained period.

Buddy System
Students across the School are appointed as Buddies to support new students joining the School, offering advice and guidance to ensure they settle quickly into life at NLCS Jeju.
